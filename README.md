## License

:copyright: This repository does not contain any license for now (i.e. there is no `LICENSE.md`). It means that, **for now**, this project does **not** accept contributions.
For more information about it, please read the following [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/#choosing-the-right-license) stating:
> You're under no obligation to choose a license. However, without a license, the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work.

The same link also mentions:
> If you're creating an open source project, we strongly encourage you to include an open source license.

Having a license in order to encourage contributions is definitely part of my future plans for this repository. I will probably choose [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) when doing so (this is subject to change).

:question: Why not having a license directly at the beginning of the project?

- I plan to use the code I'm producing right now (from this 2016 edition) for the 2018 edition in December 2018 so I can win when competing against my friends. Having no license legally prevents them from being able to use my code :laughing: :ok_hand:

# advent-of-code
Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. This contains both the [2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016) edition (done retroactively in JavaScript) and the [2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) edition (done on time).

## Execution

Within the root repository in a terminal, run `node index.js`

## Unit test

Within the root repository in a terminal, run `npm test`

For more information about it, please read the following [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/#choosing-the-right-license) stating:

The same link also mentions:

Having a license in order to encourage contributions is definitely part of my future plans for this repository. I will probably choose [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) when doing so (this is subject to change). This repository will have a license as soon as Advent of Code 2018 is done (25th of December 2018).

:question: Why not having a license directly at the beginning of the project?

- I plan to use the code I'm producing right now (from this 2016 edition) for the 2018 edition in December 2018 so I can win when competing against my friends. Having no license legally prevents them from being able to use my code :laughing: :ok_hand:

## Memorable challenges

### Easy challenges

- Day 11 part 1 and 2 were pretty easy. I solved them without coding, by simply using a spreadsheet to move cells around.
- Day 22 part 2 was pretty easy and solved in a similar way.

### Difficult challenges

- Day 9 part 2 was a really tough one
- Day 19 part 2 was a really tough one, as well. This is the only challenge that made me have a look at [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) for a clue as I was stuck for too long.
  - I was trying to find a pattern but it wasn't that obvious. After several attempts then looking at [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/), I noticed that people were getting a predictable pattern so I came back to my code and fixed my mistake in order to see it too. Once this thing done, implementing part 2 was not that hard anymore.
